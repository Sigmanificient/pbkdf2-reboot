A modern Python 3 library for PBKDF2 password hashing.

The library code is derived from the original Python 2 library [python-pbkdf2](https://github.com/dlitz/python-pbkdf2) 
that hasn't been updated for 11 years.
The main purpose of this library is to provide a more in-time version with typing support.
